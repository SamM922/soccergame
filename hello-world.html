	<p>The Champions League Semifinals are here, click the buttons to see what teams are competing!</p>
	<p>The UEFA Champions League is a soccer competition for the best teams in Europe. Teams qualify
	by placing in the top few spots in their main league. The league starts with 32 teams divided into
	8 groups. Each team plays every other team in the group twice, once at home, the other away from
	home. A team gets 3 points for a win, 1 point for a draw, and 0 points for a loss. The top 2 teams
	in each group make it to the Round of 16. Each Round of 16 matchup is played twice, one at each
	team's home stadium. The team with the most goals over the two games wins. If it is tied, the team
	with the most goals away from home wins. This is repeated for the Quarterfinals and Semifinals.
	The UEFA Champions League Final is played at a pre-determined neutral stadium.</p>
